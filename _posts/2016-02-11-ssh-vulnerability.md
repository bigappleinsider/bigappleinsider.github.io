You donâ€™t need to read this all. Just follow these two steps.

![home-brew.png]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/images/home-brew.png)


### Homebrew
    brew update
    brew install homebrew/dupes/openssh

### MacPorts
    port selfupdate
    port install openssh

After installation you must see openssh-7.1p2 where p2 means patch that fixes problem.

If you have problem with homebrew or MacPorts, please run this

    echo -e 'Host *\nUseRoaming no' >> /etc/ssh_config

or add manually Roaming no line after very first Host * you can find at /etc/ssh_config on your Mac.

### After update double check version of ssh
    ssh -V

For those who still have older version than OpenSSH_7.1p2, OpenSSL 1.0.2e 3 Dec 2015
please apply this patch

    sudo ls -l /usr/local/bin/ssh && sudo mv /usr/bin/ssh /usr/bin/ssh.bak && sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/ssh /usr/bin/ssh
