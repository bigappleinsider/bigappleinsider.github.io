sync 2 states
- change in UI triggers change in data model
- chanfe in data model changes UI

Two way data binding:
- key-value observing (KVO) - used in Ember.js, Knockout, Backbone and iOS
- dirty checking - Angular.js

Virtual DOM - fast, in-memory representation of real DOM
- when state of model changes, UI is rendered to virtual dom
- React calculates difference in virtual dom - prior vs. new
- React only updates what needs to be updated in the real DOM

react and react-dom separated into two components in order to reuse modules in rect-native
- share components that behave same across platforms

React virtual DOM is a tree of react nodes. ReactNode:
- ReactElement - light, stateless, immutable, virtual representation of a DOM element
- ReactText - sring or text

ReactFragment is an array of ReactNodes

    var React = require('react');
    var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');
    /**
    * React.createElement(type, props, children)
    * type:
    * - string: h1, div, p, etc.
    * - React class is created by React.createClass() method
    * props - js obejct passed from a parent element to a child element {className: 'header'}
    * we use className because class is reserved in js
    * children - child elements this element should have
    * */
    var reactElement = React.createElement('h1');
    ReactDOM.render(reactElement, document.getElementById('react-application'));
